% bendProp - optional - the proportion of the total distance between the
    % two points to bend to - default is 0.05
% res - optional - the resolution, or number of points to use to plot the
    % curved line - default is 50
% method - optional - the interpolation method to use - default is "cubic"

% outputs:
